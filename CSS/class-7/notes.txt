// Introduction to CSS Animation:

CSS Animation is a technique used to add movement and dynamism to web elements using CSS. In this example, we'll create a simple animation effect for colorful boxes.

// HTML Structure:

We have a container (<div class="box-container">) that holds multiple colorful boxes.
Each box is represented by a <div> element with a class of box and a specific color class (red, blue, green, yellow).

CSS Styling:

Box Styling:

Each box (box) has a width and height of 100px, with a border-radius of 10px for rounded corners.
Margin of 10px provides spacing between the boxes.
Color Classes:

Color classes (red, blue, green, yellow) define the background color of each box.
These classes are applied to the boxes to give them different colors.

Animation Properties:
animation-name: Specifies the name of the animation.
animation-duration: Sets the duration of the animation.
animation-delay: Delays the start of the animation.
animation-iteration-count: Defines the number of times the animation should play.
animation-direction: Specifies whether the animation should play in reverse.
animation-timing-function: Defines the acceleration curve of the animation.
animation-fill-mode: Specifies how the animation applies styles before and after it executes.
animation-play-state: Controls whether the animation is running or paused.


// Animation duration is set to 1s for all boxes.
Animation fill mode is set to forwards to retain the final state of the animation.

Keyframes:

// fadeIn animation:
Starts with opacity 0 and translated upward by 20px (from).
Ends with opacity 1 and returns to its original position (to).

// slideIn animation:
Starts with translated upward by 20px (from).
Ends with returning to its original position (to).
Applying Animations:

// Colorful boxes alternate between fadeIn and slideIn animations.
Boxes with classes red and green use the fadeIn animation.
Boxes with classes blue and yellow use the slideIn animation.

// Conclusion:
This example demonstrates how to create simple CSS animations for colorful boxes. By applying different animations and styles, you can add visual interest and interactivity to your web projects. Experiment with various animation properties and effects to achieve the desired results.
